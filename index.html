        <h2> A long time ago the animals of Earth started reacting violently to human contact. Since then, no contact has been made with the savage animals. Humans have evacuated to safe zones and have not exited in nearly a hundred years. The people have grown restless now and have a strong desire to see the outside world. Due to the fast exit they had made a centure earlier, no one tested to see what had caused the animals to behave so oddly. </h2>
