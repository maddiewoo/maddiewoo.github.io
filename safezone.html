        <h3 class="stampede"> Another brilliant scientist in the safe zone has been chosen to lead the voyage you so readily turned down. You think that you are safe and are therefore relaxing with the large sum of money you made from your previous job as a veterinary paothologist for a highly prestigious biotechnology company. You relax for the next few days, thinking all is well, and the safe zones are the safest place to be. No animal has gotten inside for the century it has existed. Little do you know the animals had been planning a large scale attack on safe zones around the world, and the date of the attack was scheduled for next day. As you sit in your ignorant freedom, the first ring of security falls to the animals. In a poorly voted decision, the leaders vote to keep this information from the public to avoid mass panic. As you sit drinking a pina colada, the animals break through all the security and you die in the stampede. </h3>
